RTEMS BSD Library Guide
=======================

:website: http://www.rtems.org/

The libbsd makes FreeBSD subsystems like TCP/IP, USB, SD and some more usable
for RTEMS. It tries to follow the FreeBSD development as close as possible and
therefore is updated to the latest FreeBSD HEAD revision from time to time.
To find out which version of FreeBSD is currently used as the base version for
libbsd please take a look at the
https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/pkg/rtems-libbsd/-/blob/main/freebsd-org[freebsd-org] submodule.

This is a guide which captures information on the
process of merging code from FreeBSD, building this library,
RTEMS specific support files, and general guidelines on what
modifications to the FreeBSD source are permitted.

Goals of this effort are

* update TCP/IP and provide USB in RTEMS,
* ease updating to future FreeBSD versions,
* ease tracking changes in FreeBSD code,
* minimize manual changes in FreeBSD code, and
* define stable kernel/device driver API which is implemented
by both RTEMS and FreeBSD. This is the foundation of the port.

We will work to push our changes upstream to the FreeBSD Project
and minimize changes required at each update point.

== Getting Started

=== Tool Chain ===

You need a tool chain for RTEMS based on the latest RTEMS Source Builder (RSB).

=== Installation Overview ===

. You must configure your BSP with the +--disable-networking+ option to disable
the old network stack.  Make sure no header files of the old network stack are
installed.

. Clone the Git repository +git clone https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/pkg/rtems-libbsd.git+.
. Change into the RTEMS BSD library root directory.
. If you want to run tests with a custom IP configuration instead of the default
  one you can use an adjusted `config.inc` configuration file.
. Run +waf configure ...+.
. Run +waf+.
. Run +waf install+.

Refer to the README.waf for Waf building instructions.

Make sure the submodules have been initialised and are updated. If a 'git
status' says `rtems_waf` need updating run the submodule update command:

 $ git submodule sync
 $ git submodule rtems_waf update

=== Board Support Package Requirements ===

You need the latest RTEMS version to build the libbsd master.  The Board
Support Package (BSP) must support the
http://www.rtems.org/onlinedocs/doxygen/cpukit/html/group\__rtems\__interrupt__extension.html[Interrupt Manager Extension]
// The first underscores have to be masked to stop asciidoc interpreting them
to make use of generic FreeBSD based drivers.

=== Board Support Package Configuration and Build ===

You need to configure RTEMS for the desired BSP and install it.  The BSP must
be configured with a disabled network stack.  The BSD library containing the
new network stack is a separate package.  Using a BSP installation containing
the old network stack may lead to confusion and unpredictable results.

The following script is used to build the `arm/xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu` BSP for
our internal testing purposes:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

cd ${HOME}/sandbox
rm -rf b-xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu
mkdir b-xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu
cd b-xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu
${HOME}/git-rtems/configure \
        --prefix=${HOME}/sandbox/install \
        --target=arm-rtems5 \
        --enable-rtemsbsp=xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu \
        --disable-networking && \
        make && \
        make install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `arm/xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu` BSP running on the Qemu simulator has some
benefits for development and test of the BSD library

* it offers a NULL pointer read and write protection,
* Qemu is a fast simulator,
* Qemu provides support for GDB watchpoints,
* Qemu provides support for virtual Ethernet networks, e.g. TUN and bridge
devices (you can run multiple test instances on one virtual network).

=== BSD Library Configuration and Build ===

The build system based on the Waf build system. To build with Waf please refer
to the README.waf file.

Note that the libbsd supports different buildsets. These can be selected with
the `--buildset=xxx.ini` option during the configure phase. Take a look at the
comments in `buildset/*.ini` to see which build sets are officially supported.

You can also create and provide your own buildset configuration. But remember
that it's quite easy to break something by disabling the wrong modules. Only the
configurations in the `buildset` directory are officially maintained.

===== Example Configuration for Network Tests =====

If you need some other IP configuration for the network tests that use a fixed
IP config you can copy `config.inc` to a location outside to the source tree and
adapt it. Then use the option `--net-test-config=NET_CONFIG` to pass the file to
waf's configure command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NET_CFG_SELF_IP = 10.0.0.2
NET_CFG_NETMASK = 255.255.0.0
NET_CFG_PEER_IP = 10.0.0.1
NET_CFG_GATEWAY_IP = 10.0.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== BSD Library Initialization ===

To initialise the BSD Library create a suitable rc.conf file. The FreeBSD man
page rc.conf(5) provides the details needed to create a suitable format file:

 https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?rc.conf

You can call one of three functions to run the initialisation once BSD has
initialised:

 - rtems_bsd_run_etc_rc_conf: Run /etc/rc.conf.
 - rtems_bsd_run_rc_conf: Run a user supplied file.
 - rtems_bsd_run_rc_conf_script: Run the in memory line feed separated text string.

For exapmle:

 void
 network_init(void)
 {
   rtems_status_code sc;

   sc = rtems_bsd_initialize();
   assert(sc == RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL);

   rtems_bsd_run_etc_rc_conf(true); /* verbose = true */

}

By default the networking support is builtin. Other directives can be added and
are found in 'machine/rtems-bsd-rc-conf-directives.h'. Please check the file
for the list.

The following network names are supported:

  cloned_interfaces
  ifconfig_'interface'
  defaultrouter
  hostname

For example:

 #
 # My BSD initialisation.
 #
 hostname="myhost"
 cloned_interfaces="vlan0 vlan1"
 ifconfig_re0="inet inet 10.10.10.10 netmask 255.255.255.0"
 fconfig_vlan0="inet 10.11.10.10 255.255.255.0 vlan 101 vlandev re0"
 defaultrouter="10.10.10.1"

You can also intialise the BSD library using code. The following code to
initialize the BSD library:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <assert.h>
#include <sysexits.h>

#include <rtems/bsd/bsd.h>

void
network_init(void)
{
	rtems_status_code sc;
	int exit_code;

	sc = rtems_bsd_initialize();
	assert(sc == RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL);

	exit_code = rtems_bsd_ifconfig_lo0();
	assert(exit_code == EX_OK);
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This performs the basic network stack initialization with a loopback interface.
Further initialization must be done using the standard BSD network
configuration commands
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&sektion=8[IFCONFIG(8)]
using `rtems_bsd_command_ifconfig()` and
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=route&sektion=8[ROUTE(8)]
using `rtems_bsd_command_route()`.  For an example please have a look at
`testsuite/include/rtems/bsd/test/default-network-init.h`.

=== Task Priorities and Stack Size ===

The default task priority is 96 for the interrupt server task (name "IRQS"), 98
for the timer server task (name "TIME") and 100 for all other tasks.  The
application may provide their own implementation of the
`rtems_bsd_get_task_priority()` function (for example in the module which calls
`rtems_bsd_initialize()`) if different values are desired.

The task stack size is determined by the `rtems_bsd_get_task_stack_size()`
function which may be provided by the application in case the default is not
appropriate.

=== Size for Allocator Domains ===

The size for an allocator domain can be specified via the
`rtems_bsd_get_allocator_domain_size()` function.  The application may provide
their own implementation of the `rtems_bsd_get_allocator_domain_size()`
function (for example in the module which calls `rtems_bsd_initialize()`) if
different values are desired.  The default size is 8MiB for all domains.

=== Redirecting or Disabling the Output ===

A lot of system messages are printed to the stdout by default. If you want to
redirect them you can overwrite the default print handler. That can even be done
before the libbsd initialization to catch all messages. An example would look
like follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int my_vprintf_handler(int level, const char *fmt, va_list ap) {
	/* Do something with the messages. */

	return number_of_printed_chars;
}

...
	/* In your initialization: */
	rtems_bsd_vprintf_handler old;
	old = rtems_bsd_set_vprintf_handler(my_vprintf_handler);
...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a special case, you can set the `rtems_bsd_vprintf_handler_mute(...)`
provided by libbsd to suppress all output.

== Network Interface Drivers

=== Link Up/Down Events

You can notifiy the application space of link up/down events in your network
interface driver via the if_link_state_change(LINK_STATE_UP/LINK_STATE_DOWN)
function.  The DHCPCD(8) client is a consumer of these events for example.
Make sure that the interface flag IFF_UP and the interface driver flag
IFF_DRV_RUNNING is set in case the link is up, otherwise ether_output() will
return the error status ENETDOWN.

== Shell Commands

=== HOSTNAME(1)

In addition to the standard options the RTEMS version of the HOSTNAME(1)
command supports the -m flag to set/get the multicast hostname of the
mDNS resolver instance.  See also rtems_mdns_sethostname() and
rtems_mdns_gethostname().

== Qemu

Use the following script to set up a virtual network with three tap devices
connected via one bridge device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh -x

user=`whoami`
interfaces=(1 2 3)

tap=qtap
bri=qbri

case $1 in
	up)
		sudo -i brctl addbr $bri
		for i in ${interfaces[@]} ; do
			sudo -i tunctl -t $tap$i -u $user ;
			sudo -i ifconfig $tap$i up ;
			sudo -i brctl addif $bri $tap$i ;
		done
		sudo -i ifconfig $bri up
		;;
	down)
		for i in ${interfaces[@]} ; do
			sudo -i ifconfig $tap$i down ;
			sudo -i tunctl -d $tap$i ;
		done
		sudo -i ifconfig $bri down
		sudo -i brctl delbr $bri
		;;
esac
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Connect your Qemu instance to one of the tap devices, e.g.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
qemu-system-i386 -m 512 -boot a -cpu pentium3 \
	-drive file=$HOME/qemu/pc386_fda,index=0,if=floppy,format=raw \
	-drive file=fat:$HOME/qemu/hd,format=raw \
	-net nic,model=e1000,macaddr=0e:b0:ba:5e:ba:11 \
	-net tap,ifname=qtap1,script=no,downscript=no \
	-nodefaults -nographic -serial stdio
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
qemu-system-arm \
	-serial null \
	-serial mon:stdio \
	-nographic \
	-M xilinx-zynq-a9 \
	-net nic,model=cadence_gem,macaddr=0e:b0:ba:5e:ba:11 \
	-net tap,ifname=qtap1,script=no,downscript=no \
	-m 256M \
	-kernel build/arm-rtems5-xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu/media01.exe
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that each Qemu instance uses its own MAC address to avoid an address
conflict (or otherwise use it as a test).

To connect the Qemu instances with your local network use the following
(replace 'eth0' with the network interface of your host).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
brctl addif qbri eth0
dhclient qbri
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== VDE and QEMU

On FreeBSD you can create VDE or the Virtual Distributed Ethernet to create a
network environment that does not need to run qemu as root or needing to drop
the tap's privileges to run qemu.

VDE creates a software switch with a default of 32 ports which means a single
kernel tap can support 32 qemu networking sessions.

To use VDE you need to build qemu with VDE support. The RSB can detect a VDE
plug and enable VDE support in qemu when building. On FreeBSD install the VDE
support with:

 # pkg install -u vde2

Build qemu with the RSB.

To network create a bridge and a tap. The network is 10.10.1.0/24. On FreeBSD
add to your /etc/rc.conf:

 cloned_interfaces="bridge0 tap0"
 autobridge_interfaces="bridge0"
 autobridge_bridge0="re0 tap0"
 ifconfig_re0="up"
 ifconfig_tap0="up"
 ifconfig_bridge0="inet 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"
 defaultrouter="10.10.1.1"

Start the VDE switch as root:

 # sysctl net.link.tap.user_open=1
 # sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
 # vde_switch -d -s /tmp/vde1 -M /tmp/mgmt1 -tap tap0 -m 660 --mgmtmode 660
 # chmod 660 /dev/tap0

You can connect to the VDE switch's management channel using:

 $ vdeterm /tmp/mgmt1

To run qemu:

 $ qemu-system-arm \
	-serial null \
	-serial mon:stdio \
	-nographic \
	-M xilinx-zynq-a9 \
	-net nic,model=cadence_gem,macaddr=0e:b0:ba:5e:ba:11 \
	-net vde,id=vde0,sock=/tmp/vde1
	-m 256M \
	-kernel build/arm-rtems5-xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu/rcconf02.exe

== Issues and TODO

* PCI support on x86 uses a quick and dirty hack, see pci_reserve_map().

* Priority queues are broken with clustered scheduling.

* Per-CPU data should be enabled once the new stack is ready for SMP.

* Per-CPU NETISR(9) should be enabled onece the new stack is ready for SMP.

* Multiple routing tables are not supported.  Every FIB value is set to zero
  (= BSD_DEFAULT_FIB).

* Process identifiers are not supported.  Every PID value is set to zero
  (= BSD_DEFAULT_PID).

* User credentials are not supported.  The following functions allow the
  operation for everyone
  - prison_equal_ip4(),
  - chgsbsize(),
  - cr_cansee(),
  - cr_canseesocket() and
  - cr_canseeinpcb().

* A basic USB functionality test that is known to work on Qemu is desirable.

* Adapt generic IRQ PIC interface code to Simple Vectored Interrupt Model
  so that those architectures can use new TCP/IP and USB code.

* freebsd-userspace/rtems/include/sys/syslog.h is a copy from the old
  RTEMS TCP/IP stack. For some reason, the __printflike markers do not
  compile in this environment. We may want to use the FreeBSD syslog.h
  and get this addressed.

* in_cksum implementations for architectures not supported by FreeBSD.
  This will require figuring out where to put implementations that do
  not originate from FreeBSD and are populated via the script.

* MAC support functions are not thread-safe ("freebsd/lib/libc/posix1e/mac.c").

* IFCONFIG(8): IEEE80211 support is disabled.  This module depends on a XML
  parser and mmap().

* get_cyclecount(): The implementation is a security problem.

* What to do with the priority parameter present in the FreeBSD synchronization
  primitives and the thread creation functions?

* TASKQUEUE(9): Support spin mutexes.

* ZONE(9): Review allocator lock usage in rtems-bsd-chunk.c.

* KQUEUE(2): Choose proper lock for global kqueue list.

* TIMEOUT(9): Maybe use special task instead of timer server to call
  callout_tick().

* sysctl_handle_opaque(): Implement reliable snapshots.

* PING6(8): What to do with SIGALARM?

* <sys/param.h>: Update Newlib to use a MSIZE of 256.

* BPF(4): Add support for zero-copy buffers.

* UNIX(4): Fix race conditions in the area of socket object and file node
  destruction.  Add support for file descriptor transmission via control
  messages.

* PRINTF(9): Add support for log(), the %D format specifier is missing in the
  normal printf() family.

* Why is the interrupt server used?  The BSD interrupt handlers can block on
synchronization primitives like mutexes.  This is in contrast to RTEMS
interrupt service routines.  The BSPs using the generic interrupt support must
implement the `bsp_interrupt_vector_enable()` and
`bsp_interrupt_vector_disable()` routines.  They normally enable/disable a
particular interrupt source at the interrupt controller.  This can be used to
implement the interrupt server.  The interrupt server is a task that wakes-up
in case an associated interrupt happens.  The interrupt source is disabled in
a generic interrupt handler that wakes-up the interrupt server task.   Once the
postponed interrupt processing is performed in the interrupt server the
interrupt source is enabled again.

* Convert all BSP linkcmds to use a linkcmds.base so the sections are
easier to insert.

* NIC Device Drivers
- Only common PCI NIC drivers have been included in the initial set. These
do not include any system on chip or ISA drivers.
- PCI configuration probe does not appear to happen to determine if a
NIC is in I/O or memory space. We have worked around this by using a
static hint to tell the fxp driver the correct mode. But this needs to
be addressed.
- The ISA drivers require more BSD infrastructure to be addressed. This was
outside the scope of the initial porting effort.

== FreeBSD Source

You should be able to rely on FreebSD manual pages and documentation
for details on the code itself.

== BSD Library Source

== Initialization of the BSD Library

The initialization of the BSD library is based on the FreeBSD SYSINIT(9)
infrastructure.  The key to initializing a system is to ensure that the desired
device drivers are explicitly pulled into the linked application.  This plus
linking against the BSD library (`libbsd.a`) will pull in the necessary FreeBSD
infrastructure.

The FreeBSD kernel is not a library like the RTEMS kernel.  It is a bunch of
object files linked together.  If we have a library, then creating the
executable is simple.  We begin with a start symbol and recursively resolve all
references.  With a bunch of object files linked together we need a different
mechanism.  Most object files don't know each other.  Lets say we have a driver
module.  The rest of the system has no references to this driver module.  The
driver module needs a way to tell the rest of the system: Hey, kernel I am
here, please use my services!

This registration of independent components is performed by SYSINIT(9) and
specializations:

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=SYSINIT

The SYSINIT(9) uses some global data structures that are placed in a certain
section.  In the linker command file we need this:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.rtemsroset : {
        KEEP (*(SORT(.rtemsroset.*)))
}

.rtemsrwset : {
        KEEP (*(SORT(.rtemsrwset.*)))
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This results for example in this executable layout:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can see, that some global data structures are collected into
continuous memory areas.  This memory area can be identified by start and stop
symbols.  This constructs a table of uniform items.

The low level FreeBSD code calls at some time during the initialization the
mi_startup() function (machine independent startup).  This function will sort
the SYSINIT(9) set and call handler functions which perform further
initialization.  The last step is the scheduler invocation.

The SYSINIT(9) routines are run in mi_startup() which is called by
rtems_bsd_initialize().

This is also explained in "The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD
Operating System" section 14.3 "Kernel Initialization".

In RTEMS we have a library and not a bunch of object files.  Thus we need a way
to pull-in the desired services out of the libbsd.  Here the
`rtems-bsd-sysinit.h` comes into play.  The SYSINIT(9) macros have been
modified and extended for RTEMS in `<sys/kernel.h>`:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#ifndef __rtems__
#define	C_SYSINIT(uniquifier, subsystem, order, func, ident)	\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you see that the SYSINIT(9) entries are no longer static.  The
\*_REFERENCE() macros will create references to the corresponding modules which
are later resolved by the linker.  The application has to provide an object
file with references to all required FreeBSD modules.

The FreeBSD device model is quite elaborated (with follow-ups):

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=driver

The devices form a tree with the Nexus device at a high-level.  This Nexus
device is architecture specific in FreeBSD.  In RTEMS we have our own Nexus
device, see `rtemsbsd/bsp/bsp-bsd-nexus-devices.c`.

=== SYSCTL_NODE Example

During development, we had an undefined reference to
_bsd_sysctl__net_children that we had trouble tracking down. Thanks to
Chris Johns, we located it. He explained how to read SYSCTL_NODE
definitions. This line from freebsd/netinet/in_proto.c is attempting
to add the "inet" node to the parent node "_net".

----
SYSCTL_NODE(_net,      PF_INET,         inet,   CTLFLAG_RW, 0,
        "Internet Family");
----

Our problem was that we could not find where _bsd_sysctl__net_children
was defined. Chris suggested that when in doubt compile with -save-temps
and look at the preprocessed .i files. But he did not need that. He
explained that this the symbol name _bsd_sysctl__net_children was
automatically generated by a SYSCTL_NODE as follows:

* _bsd_ - added by RTEMS modifications to SYSCTL_NODE macro
* sysctl_ - boilerplace added by SYSCTL_NODE macro
* "" - empty string for parent node
* net - name of SYSCTL_NODE
* children - added by SYSCTL macros

This was all generated by a support macro declaring the node as this:

----
struct sysctl_oid_list SYSCTL_NODE_CHILDREN(parent, name);
----

Given this information, we located this SYSCTL_NODE declaration in
kern/kern_mib.c

----
SYSCTL_NODE(, CTL_KERN,   kern,   CTLFLAG_RW, 0,
        "High kernel, proc, limits &c");
----

== Core FreeBSD APIs and RTEMS Replacements ==

=== SX(9) (Shared/exclusive locks) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sx

Binary semaphores (this neglects the ability to allow shared access).

=== MUTEX(9) (Mutual exclusion) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mutex

Binary semaphores (not recursive mutexes are not supported this way).

=== RWLOCK(9) (Reader/writer lock) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rwlock

POSIX r/w lock.

=== RMLOCK(9) (Reader/writer lock optimized for mostly read access patterns) ===

Note:  This object was implemented as a wrapper for RWLOCK in the rm_lock header file.

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rmlock

POSIX r/w lock.

=== CONDVAR(9) (Condition variables) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=condvar

POSIX condition variables with modifications (hack).

=== CALLOUT(9) (Timer functions) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=callout

Timer server.

=== TASKQUEUE(9) (Asynchronous task execution) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=taskqueue

TBD.

=== KTHREAD(9), KPROC(9) (Tasks) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kthread

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kproc

Tasks.

=== ZONE(9) (Zone allocator) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zone

TBD.

=== devfs (Device file system) ===

There is a minimal implementation based on IMFS. The mount point is fixed to
"/dev". Note that the devfs is only used by the cdev subsystem. cdev has been
adapted so that the full path (including the leading "/dev") is given to devfs.
This saves some copy operations.

devfs_create() first creates the full path and then creates an IMFS generic node
for the device.

TBD: remove empty paths on devfs_destroy().

=== psignal (Signals) ===

TBD.  Seems to be not needed.

=== poll, select ===

TBD.  Seems to be not needed.

=== RMAN(9) (Resource management) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rman

TBD.  Seems to be not needed.

=== DEVCLASS(9), DEVICE(9), DRIVER(9), MAKE_DEV(9) (Device management) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=devclass

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=device

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=driver

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=make_dev

Use FreeBSD implementation as far as possible.  FreeBSD has a nice API for
dynamic device handling.  It may be interesting for RTEMS to use this API
internally in the future.

=== BUS_SPACE(9), BUS_DMA(9) (Bus and DMA access) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bus_space

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bus_dma

Likely BSP dependent.  A default implementation for memory mapped linear access
is easy to provide.  The current heap implementation supports all properties
demanded by bus_dma (including the boundary constraint).

== RTEMS Replacements by File Description ==

Note:  Files with a status of USB are used by the USB test and have at least
been partially tested.  If they contain both USB and Nic, then they are used
by both and MAY contain methods that have not been tested yet.  Files that
are only used by the Nic test are the most suspect.

== Notes by File ==

altq_subr.c - Arbitrary choices were made in this file that RTEMS would
not support tsc frequency change.  Additionally, the clock frequency
for machclk_freq is always measured for RTEMS.

conf.h - In order to add make_dev and destroy_dev, variables in the cdev
structure that were not being used were conditionally compiled out. The
capability of supporting children did not appear to be needed and was
not implemented in the rtems version of these routines.

----

To add a NIC edit rtemsbsd/include/bsp/nexus-devices.h and add the driver
reference to the architecture and/or BSP. For example to add the RealTek driver
add:

SYSINIT_DRIVER_REFERENCE(re, pci);

and to add the MII PHY driver add:

SYSINIT_DRIVER_REFERENCE(rge, miibus);

The PC BSP has these entries.

Symbols (A)
         pci_get_vpd_ident

=== Cadence ===

The cadence driver works on the Xilinx Zynq platform. The hardware checksum
support works on real hardware but does not seem to be supported on qemu
therefore the default state is to disable TXCSUM and RXCSUM and this can be
enabled from the shell with:

  # ifconfig cgem0 rxcsum txcsum

or with an ioctl call to the network interface driver with SIOCSIFCAP and the
mask IFCAP_TXCSUM and IFCAP_RXCSUM set.

== PF (Firewall) ==

It is possible to use PF as a firewall. See
[https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/firewalls-pf.html] for details on the
range of functions and for how to configure the firewall.

The following is necessary to use PF on RTEMS:

- You have to provide a +/etc/pf.os+ file. The firewall can use it for passive
  OS fingerprinting. If you don't want to use this feature, the file may contain
  nothing except a line of comment (for example "# empty").

- If some filters use protocol names (like tcp or udp) you have to provide a
  +/etc/protocols+ file.

- If some filters use service names (like ssh or http) you have to provide a
  +/etc/services+ file.

- Create a rule file (normally +/etc/pf.conf+). See the FreeBSD manual for the
  syntax.

- Load the rule file using the pfctl command and enable pf. Please note that the
  pfctl command needs a lot of stack. You should use at least
  RTEMS_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE + 8192 Bytes of stack. An example initialisation can
  look like follows:

----
	int exit_code;
	char *params[] = {
		"pfctl",
		"-f",
		"/etc/pf.conf",
		"-e",
		NULL
	};

	exit_code = rtems_bsd_command_pfctl(ARGC(params), params);
	assert(exit_code == EXIT_SUCCSESS);
----

=== Known restrictions ===

- Currently PF on RTEMS always uses the configuration for memory restricted
  systems (on FreeBSD that means systems with less than 100 MB RAM). This is
  fixed in +pfctl_init_options()+.

== Wireless Network (WLAN) ==

The libbsd provides a basic support for WLAN. Note that currently this support
is still in an early state. The WLAN support is _not_ enabled in the default
buildset. You have to configure libbsd with the
`--buildset=buildset/everything.ini` to enable that feature.

The following gives a rough overview over the necessary steps to connect to an
encrypted network with an RTL8188EU based WiFi dongle:

- Reference all necessary module for your BSP. For some BSPs this is already
  done in the nexus-devices.h:

----
	SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(wlan_ratectl_none);
	SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(wlan_sta);
	SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(wlan_amrr);
	SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(wlan_wep);
	SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(wlan_tkip);
	SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(wlan_ccmp);
	SYSINIT_DRIVER_REFERENCE(rtwn_usb, uhub);
	SYSINIT_REFERENCE(rtwn_rtl8188eufw);
----

- Create your wlan device using ifconfig:
  +ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev rtwn0 up+

- Start a wpa_supplicant instance for that device:
  + wpa_supplicant_fork -Dbsd -iwlan0 -c/media/mmcsd-0-0/wpa_supplicant.conf+

Note that the wpa_supplicant will only be active till the device goes down. A
workaround is to just restart it every time it exits.

=== Known restrictions ===

- The network interface (e.g. wlan0) is currently not automatically created. It
  would be nice, if some service would create it as soon as for example a USB
  device is connected. In FreeBSD the names are assigned via rc.conf with lines
  like +wlans_rtwn0="wlan0"+.

- wpa_supplicant hast to be started after the device is created. It has to be
  restarted every time the connection goes down. Instead of this behaviour,
  there should be some service that starts and restarts wpa_supplicant
  automatically if a interface is ready. Probably the dhcpcd hooks could be used
  for that.

- The current wpa_supplicant implementation is protected with a lock so it can't
  be started more than one time. If multiple interface should be used, all have
  to be handled by that single instance. That makes it hard to add interfaces
  dynamically. wpa_supplicant should be reviewed thoroughly whether multiple
  instances could be started in parallel.

- The control interface of wpa_supplicant most likely doesn't work. The wpa_cli
  application is not ported.

== IPSec ==

The IPSec support is optional in libbsd. It is disabled in the default build
set. Please make sure to use a build set with +netipsec = on+.

To use IPSec the following configuration is necessary:

----
SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(if_gif);
SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(cryptodev);
RTEMS_BSD_RC_CONF_SYSINT(rc_conf_ipsec)
RTEMS_BSD_DEFINE_NEXUS_DEVICE(cryptosoft, 0, 0, NULL);
----

Alternatively you can use the `RTEMS_BSD_CONFIG_IPSEC` which also includes the
rc.conf support for ipsec. It's still necessary to include a crypto device in
your config (`cryptosoft` in the above sample).

The necessary initialization steps for a IPSec connection are similar to the
steps on a FreeBSD-System. The example assumes the following setup:

- RTEMS external IP: 192.168.10.1/24
- RTEMS internal IP: 10.10.1.1/24
- remote external IP: 192.168.10.10/24
- remote internal IP: 172.24.0.1/24
- shared key: "mysecretkey"

With this the following steps are necessary:

- Create a gif0 device:

----
SHLL [/] #  ifconfig gif0 create
----

- Configure the gif0 device:

----
SHLL [/] # ifconfig gif0 10.10.1.1 172.24.0.1
SHLL [/] # ifconfig gif0 tunnel 192.168.10.1 192.168.10.10
----

- Add a route to the remote net via the remote IP:

----
SHLL [/] # route add 172.24.0.0/24 172.24.0.1
----

- Call `setkey` with a correct rule set:

----
SHLL [/] # cat /etc/setkey.conf
flush;
spdflush;
spdadd  10.10.1.0/24 172.24.0.0/24 any -P out ipsec esp/tunnel/192.168.10.1-192.168.10.10/use;
spdadd 172.24.0.0/24  10.10.1.0/24 any -P in  ipsec esp/tunnel/192.168.10.10-192.168.10.1/use;
SHLL [/] # setkey -f /etc/setkey.conf
----

- Start a ike-daemon (racoon) with a correct configuration.
----
SHLL [/] # cat /etc/racoon.conf
path	pre_shared_key "/etc/racoon_psk.txt";
log	info;

padding # options are not to be changed
{
	maximum_length			20;
	randomize			off;
	strict_check			off;
	exclusive_tail			off;
}

listen  # address [port] that racoon will listen on
{
	isakmp				192.168.10.1[500];
}

remote 192.168.10.10 [500]
{
	exchange_mode			main;
	my_identifier			address 192.168.10.1;
	peers_identifier		address 192.168.10.10;
	proposal_check			obey;
	
	proposal {
		encryption_algorithm	3des;
		hash_algorithm		md5;
		authentication_method	pre_shared_key;
		lifetime		time 3600 sec;
		dh_group		2;
	}
}

sainfo (address 10.10.1.0/24 any address 172.24.0.0/24 any)
{
	pfs_group			2;
	lifetime			time 28800 sec;
	encryption_algorithm		3des;
	authentication_algorithm	hmac_md5;
	compression_algorithm		deflate;
}
SHLL [/] # cat /etc/racoon_psk.txt
192.168.10.10	mysecretkey
SHLL [/] # racoon -F -f /etc/racoon.conf
----

All commands can be called via the respective API functions. For racoon there is
a `rtems_bsd_racoon_daemon()` function that forks of racoon as a task.

Alternatively IPSec can also be configured via rc.conf entries:

----
cloned_interfaces="gif0"
ifconfig_gif0="10.10.1.1 172.24.0.1 tunnel 192.168.10.1 192.168.10.10"
ike_enable="YES"
ike_program="racoon"
ike_flags="-F -f /etc/racoon.conf"
ike_priority="250"

ipsec_enable="YES"
ipsec_file="/etc/setkey.conf"
----

ATTENTION: It is possible that the first packets slip through the tunnel without
encryption (true for FreeBSD as well as RTEMS). You might want to set up a
firewall rule to prevent that.

== Problems to report to FreeBSD ==

The MMAP_NOT_AVAILABLE define is inverted on its usage.  When it is
defined the mmap method is called. Additionally, it is not used
thoroughly. It is not used in the unmap portion of the source.
The file rec_open.c uses the define MMAP_NOT_AVAILABLE to wrap
the call to mmap and file rec_close.c uses the munmap method.
