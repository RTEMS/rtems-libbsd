RTEMS uses FreeBSD as the source of its TCP/IP and USB stacks.
This is a developers guide which captures information on the
process of merging code from FreeBSD, building this library,
RTEMS specific support files, and general guidelines on what
modifications to the FreeBSD source are permitted.

Goals of this effort are:

* Update TCP/IP and provide USB in RTEMS
* Ease updating to future FreeBSD versions
* Ease tracking changes in FreeBSD code
* Minimize manual changes in FreeBSD code
* Define stable kernel/device driver API which is implemented
by both RTEMS and FreeBSD. This is the foundation of the port.

We will work to push our changes upstream to the FreeBSD Project
and minimize changes required at each update point.

**************************************************************
This is a work in progress and is very likely to be incomplete.
Please help by adding to it.
**************************************************************

== Source Code Version Information

* FreeBSD 8.2 SVN r255967
* RTEMS 4.11
  - BSP must have support for all new BSD sys sections
  - It is preferable if the BSP uses linkcmds.base.
  - BSP must be from an architecture with Programmable Interrupt Controller
    interrupt model.

The latest port uses the FreeBSD sources as a Git submodule which will
generally be referred to as the FreeBSD source in this document.  Previously a
FreeBSD 8.2 SVN checkout was used.  The SVN checkout command corresponding to
the current Git submodule commit is this
  svn co http://svn.freebsd.org/base/releng/8.2 -r255967 freebsd-8.2

== Issues and To Do
* Per-CPU data should be enabled once the new stack is ready for SMP.

* Per-CPU NETISR(9) should be enabled onece the new stack is ready for SMP.

* Multiple routing tables are not supported.  Every FIB value is set to zero
  (= BSD_DEFAULT_FIB).

* Process identifiers are not supported.  Every PID value is set to zero
  (= BSD_DEFAULT_PID).

* User credentials are not supported.  The following functions allow the
  operation for everyone
  - prison_equal_ip4(),
  - chgsbsize(),
  - cr_cansee(),
  - cr_canseesocket() and
  - cr_canseeinpcb().

* Sebastian Huber and Joel Sherrill discussed the need for a a basic USB
  functionality test that is known to work on qemu pc.

* Adapt generic IRQ PIC interface code to Simple Vectored Interrupt Model
  so that those architectures can use new TCP/IP and USB code. 

* freebsd-userspace/rtems/include/sys/syslog.h is a copy from the old
  RTEMS TCP/IP stack. For some reason, the __printflike markers do not
  compile in this environment. We may want to use the FreeBSD syslog.h
  and get this addressed.

* in_cksum implementations for architectures not supported by FreeBSD.
  This will require figuring out where to put implementations that do
  not originate from FreeBSD and are populated via the script.

* linker section issues: I have undefined symbols for
  `_bsd__start_set_sysinit_set` and `_bsd__stop_set_sysinit_set`.
  Is this the only type of new section magic?  What about the old sysctl_set?
  I added this to my linkcmds.  

* MAC support functions are not thread-safe ("freebsd/lib/libc/posix1e/mac.c").

* IFCONFIG(8): IEEE80211 support is disabled.  This module depends on a XML
  parser and mmap().

[listing]
----
    /* sysinit section? */
    . = ALIGN (16);
    _bsd__start_set_sysinit_set = .;
    *(set_sys_init_*);
    _bsd__stop_set_sysinit_set = .;

----

* Why is the interrupt server used?  The BSD interrupt handlers can block on
synchronization primitives like mutexes.  This is in contrast to RTEMS
interrupt service routines.  The BSPs using the generic interrupt support must
implement the `bsp_interrupt_vector_enable()` and
`bsp_interrupt_vector_disable()` routines.  They normally enable/disable a
particular interrupt source at the interrupt controller.  This can be used to
implement the interrupt server.  The interrupt server is a task that wakes-up
in case an associated interrupt happens.  The interrupt source is disabled in
a generic interrupt handler that wakes-up the interrupt server task.   Once the
postponed interrupt processing is performed in the interrupt server the
interrupt source is enabled again.

* Convert all BSP linkcmds to use a linkcmds.base so the sections are 
easier to insert.

* rtems-bsd-init-with-irq.c:
  rtems_bsd_initialize_with_interrupt_server() has reference to 
    rtems_interrupt_server_initialize() and this method is unimplemented
    - XXX BSP implements pieces
    - BSPs using this software stack must support it apparently.
    - What about Simple Vectored architectures?

* We carried over use of notepad 0 for per task information. This should
be changed.

* maxproc variable referenced by rtems-bsd-resource.c.  What should it
be set to?

* ngroups_max variable referenced by rtems-bsd-prot.c.  - What should
it be set to?

* NIC Device Drivers
- Only common PCI NIC drivers have been included in the initial set. These
do not include any system on chip or ISA drivers.
- PCI configuration probe does not appear to happen to determine if a
NIC is in I/O or memory space. We have worked around this by using a
static hint to tell the fxp driver the correct mode. But this needs to
be addressed.
- The ISA drivers require more BSD infrastructure to be addressed. This was 
outside the scope of the initial porting effort.

== FreeBSD Source

You should be able to rely on FreebSD manual pages and documentation
for details on the code itself.

=== Automatically Generated FreeBSD Files

The FreeBSD source tarball includes a file named Makefile.rtems which
has stanzas to automatically generate some files using awk. For details
on this, see http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kobj&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+9.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html

XXX This needs more detail.

=== Rules for Modifying FreeBSD Source

* Only add lines.  Subtract code by added "ifndef __rtems__". This makes
merging easier in the future.

== libbsd Source

=== What is in git

The git source is a self-contained kit with FreeBSD and RTEMS components
pre-merged. The Makefile in this kit is automatically generated.

Any changes to sources in the freebsd or contrib directories will need to
be merged upstream into our master FreeBSD svn checkout.

The FreeBSD sources managed in the rtems-libbsd git repository (e.g. contrib
and freebsd directories) contain the "managed" version of the
FreeBSD source.  The FreeBSD SVN source is the "master" version. The
freebsd-to-rtems.py script is used to transfer files between the two
trees. In general terms, if you have modified FreeBSD (i.e. anything in the
freebsd directory) in the rtems-libbsd tree, you will need to run the script
in "revert" or "reverse" mode using the -R switch. This will copy the source
back to your local copy of the FreeBSD source so you can run "svn diff" against
the upstream FreeBSD source. If you want to transfer source files from the
FreeBSD SVN checkout to the rtems-libbsd tree, then you must run the script in
"forward" mode (the default).

=== Building rtems-libbsd source

You need to configure RTEMS for the desired BSP and install it. The
following is the script used to build the powerpc/psim BSP for our
internal testing purposes:

[listing]
----
#! /bin/sh

cd ${HOME}/newbsd
rm -rf b-psim
mkdir b-psim
cd b-psim
../git/rtems/configure --target=powerpc-rtems4.11 \
  --enable-rtemsbsp=psim --disable-networking \
  --enable-tests=samples \
  --prefix=${HOME}/newbsd/bsp-install >c.log 2>&1 && \
  make >b.log 2>&1 && \
  make install >i.log 2>&1
echo $?
----

Then edit the file config.inc to set RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH appropriately
to indicate the ${prefix}/${target}/${BSP}.  Continuing on the above,
the config.inc used to match the above is:

[listing]
----
RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH = ${HOME}/newbsd/bsp-install/powerpc-rtems4.11/psim/
INSTALL_BASE = ${HOME}/newbsd/install
----

The above installs the rtems-libbsd kit into a separate place from 
RTEMS and the BSP. The rtems-libbsd tests are built against an installed
image of the rtems-libbsd. By keeping it in a separate installation point
from RTEMS itself, this makes it easier to remove a libbsd installation
and have a clean test point.

[listing]
----
make
make install
make -C testsuite
----

At this point, we expect multiple linker errors. That is what we are
currently working on.

=== Organization

The top level directory contains a few directories and files. The following
are important to understand:

* freebsd-to-rtems.py - script to convert to and free FreeBSD and RTEMS trees
* Makefile - automatically generated
* contrib/ - from FreeBSD by script.
* freebsd/ - from FreeBSD by script.
* rtemsbsd/ - RTEMS specific implementations of FreeBSD kernel support routines.
* testsuite/ - RTEMS specific tests
* libbsd.txt - Documentation in Asciidoc

== Moving Code Between FreeBSD SVN and rtems-libbsd

The script freebsd-to-rtems.py is used to copy code from FreeBSD to the
rtems-libbsd tree and to reverse this process. This script attempts to
automate this process as much as possible and performs some transformations
on the FreeBSD code. Its command line arguments are shown below:

[listing]
----
freebsd-to-rtems.py [args]
  -?|-h|--help     print this and exit
  -d|--dry-run     run program but no modifications
  -D|--diff        provide diff of files between trees
  -e|--early-exit  evaluate arguments, print results, and exit
  -m|--makefile    just generate Makefile
  -R|--reverse     default FreeBSD -> RTEMS, reverse that
  -r|--rtems       RTEMS directory
  -f|--freebsd     FreeBSD directory
  -v|--verbose     enable verbose output mode
----

In its default mode of operation, freebsd-to-rtems.py is used to copy code
from FreeBSD to the rtems-libbsd tree and perform transformations.  In forward
mode, the script may be requested to just generate the Makefile.

In "reverse mode", this script undoes those transformations and copies 
the source code back to the FreeBSD SVN tree. This allows us to do 
'svn diff', evaluate changes made by the RTEMS Project, and report changes
back to FreeBSD upstream.

In either mode, the script may be asked to perform a dry-run or be verbose.
Also, in either mode, the script is also smart enough to avoid copying over
files which have not changed. This means that the timestamps of files are
not changed unless the contents change. The script will also report the
number of files which changed. In verbose mode, the script will print
the name of the files which are changed.

The following is an example forward run with no changes.

[listing]
----
$ ~/newbsd/git/libbsd-8.2/freebsd-to-rtems.py \
    -r /home/joel/newbsd/git/libbsd-8.2 \
    -f /home/joel/newbsd/libbsd/freebsd-8.2 -v
Verbose:                yes
Dry Run:                no
Only Generate Makefile: no
RTEMS Directory:        /home/joel/newbsd/git/libbsd-8.2

Direction:              forward
Generating into /home/joel/newbsd/git/libbsd-8.2
0 files were changed.
----

The script may also be used to generate a diff in either forward or reverse
direction.

== Initialization of rtems-libbsd

The initialization of the rtems-libbsd is based on the FreeBSD SYSINIT(9)
infrastructure.  The key to initializing a system is to ensure that the desired
device drivers are explicitly pulled into the linked application.  This plus
linking against the libbsd library will pull in the necessary FreeBSD
infrastructure.

The FreeBSD kernel is not a library like the RTEMS kernel.  It is a bunch of
object files linked together.  If we have a library, then creating the
executable is simple.  We begin with a start symbol and recursively resolve all
references.  With a bunch of object files linked together we need a different
mechanism.  Most object files don't know each other.  Lets say we have a driver
module.  The rest of the system has no references to this driver module.  The
driver module needs a way to tell the rest of the system: Hey, kernel I am
here, please use my services!

This registration of independent components is performed by SYSINIT(9) and
specializations:

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=SYSINIT

The SYSINIT(9) uses some global data structures that are placed in a certain
section.  In the linker command file we need this:

[listing]
----
.robsdsets : {
    _bsd__start_set_modmetadata_set = .;
    *(_bsd_set_modmetadata_set);
    _bsd__stop_set_modmetadata_set = .;
    _bsd__start_set_sysctl_set = .;
    *(_bsd_set_sysctl_set);
    _bsd__stop_set_sysctl_set = .;
} > REGION_RODATA AT > REGION_RODATA_LOAD

.rwbsdsets : {
    _bsd__start_set_sysinit_set = .;
    *(_bsd_set_sysinit_set);
    _bsd__stop_set_sysinit_set = .;
} > REGION_DATA AT > REGION_DATA_LOAD
----

Here you can see, that these global data structures are collected into
continuous memory areas.  This memory area can be identified by start and stop
symbols.  This constructs a table of uniform items.

The low level FreeBSD code calls at some time during the initialization the
mi_startup() function (machine independent startup).  This function will sort
the SYSINIT(9) set and call handler functions which perform further
initialization.  The last step is the scheduler invocation.

The SYSINIT(9) routines are run in mi_startup() which is called by
rtems_bsd_initialize().

This is also explained in "The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD
Operating System" section 14.3 "Kernel Initialization".

In RTEMS we have a library and not a bunch of object files.  Thus we need a way
to pull-in the desired services out of the libbsd.  Here the
"rtems-bsd-sysinit.h" comes into play.  The SYSINIT(9) macros have been
modified and extended for RTEMS in "sys/kernel.h":

[listing]
----
#ifndef __rtems__
#define    C_SYSINIT(uniquifier, subsystem, order, func, ident) \
    static struct sysinit uniquifier ## _sys_init = { \
        subsystem, \
        order, \
        func, \
        (ident) \
    }; \
    DATA_SET(sysinit_set,uniquifier ## _sys_init)
#else /* __rtems__ */
#define    SYSINIT_ENTRY_NAME(uniquifier) \
    _bsd_ ## uniquifier ## _sys_init
#define    SYSINIT_REFERENCE_NAME(uniquifier) \
    _bsd_ ## uniquifier ## _sys_init_ref
#define    C_SYSINIT(uniquifier, subsystem, order, func, ident) \
    struct sysinit SYSINIT_ENTRY_NAME(uniquifier) = { \
        subsystem, \
        order, \
        func, \
        (ident) \
    }; \
    DATA_SET(sysinit_set,SYSINIT_ENTRY_NAME(uniquifier))
#define    SYSINIT_REFERENCE(uniquifier) \
    extern struct sysinit SYSINIT_ENTRY_NAME(uniquifier); \
    static struct sysinit const * const \
    SYSINIT_REFERENCE_NAME(uniquifier) __used \
    = &SYSINIT_ENTRY_NAME(uniquifier)
#define    SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(mod) \
    SYSINIT_REFERENCE(mod ## module)
#define    SYSINIT_DRIVER_REFERENCE(driver, bus) \
    SYSINIT_MODULE_REFERENCE(driver ## _ ## bus)
#endif /* __rtems__ */
----

Here you see that the SYSINIT(9) entries are no longer static.  The
*_REFERENCE() macros will create references to the corresponding modules which
are later resolved by the linker.  The application has to provide an object
file with references to all required FreeBSD modules.

The FreeBSD device model is quite elaborated (with follow-ups):

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=driver

The devices form a tree with the Nexus device at a high-level.  This Nexus
device is architecture specific in FreeBSD.  In RTEMS we have our own Nexus
device, see "rtems-bsd-nexus.c".  It uses a table to add child devices:

[listing]
----
const char *const _bsd_nexus_devices [] = {
    #ifdef NEED_USB_OHCI
        "ohci",
    #endif
    #ifdef NEED_USB_EHCI
        "ehci",
    #endif
    #ifdef NEED_SDHC
        "sdhci",
    #endif
    NULL
};
----

This table must be provided by the application.

=== SYSCTL_NODE Example

During development, we had an undefined reference to
_bsd_sysctl__net_children that we had trouble tracking down. Thanks to
Chris Johns, we located it. He explained how to read SYSCTL_NODE
definitions. This line from freebsd/netinet/in_proto.c is attempting
to add the "inet" node to the parent node "_net".

[listing]
----
SYSCTL_NODE(_net,      PF_INET,         inet,   CTLFLAG_RW, 0,
        "Internet Family");
----

Our problem was that we could not find where _bsd_sysctl__net_children
was defined. Chris suggested that when in doubt compile with -save-temps
and look at the preprocessed .i files. But he did not need that. He
explained that this the symbol name _bsd_sysctl__net_children was
automatically generated by a SYSCTL_NODE as follows:

* _bsd_ - added by RTEMS modifications to SYSCTL_NODE macro
* sysctl_ - boilerplace added by SYSCTL_NODE macro
* "" - empty string for parent node
* net - name of SYSCTL_NODE
* children - added by SYSCTL macros
  
This was all generated by a support macro declaring the node as this:

[listing]
----
struct sysctl_oid_list SYSCTL_NODE_CHILDREN(parent, name);
----

Given this information, we located this SYSCTL_NODE declaration in 
kern/kern_mib.c

[listing]
----
SYSCTL_NODE(, CTL_KERN,   kern,   CTLFLAG_RW, 0,
        "High kernel, proc, limits &c");
----

== Core FreeBSD APIs and RTEMS Replacements ==

=== SX(9) (Shared/exclusive locks) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sx

Binary semaphores (this neglects the ability to allow shared access).

=== MUTEX(9) (Mutual exclusion) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mutex

Binary semaphores (not recursive mutexes are not supported this way).

=== RWLOCK(9) (Reader/writer lock) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rwlock

POSIX r/w lock.

=== RMLOCK(9) (Reader/writer lock optimized for mostly read access patterns) ===

Note:  This object was implemented as a wrapper for RWLOCK in the rm_lock header file.

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rmlock

POSIX r/w lock.

=== CONDVAR(9) (Condition variables) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=condvar

POSIX condition variables with modifications (hack).

=== CALLOUT(9) (Timer functions) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=callout

Timer server.

=== TASKQUEUE(9) (Asynchronous task execution) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=taskqueue

TBD.

=== KTHREAD(9), KPROC(9) (Tasks) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kthread

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kproc

Tasks.

=== ZONE(9) (Zone allocator) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zone

TBD.

=== devfs (Device file system) ===

Dummy, IMFS or new implementation (currently dummy).

=== psignal (Signals) ===

TBD.  Seems to be not needed.

=== poll, select ===

TBD.  Seems to be not needed.

=== RMAN(9) (Resource management) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rman

TBD.  Seems to be not needed.

=== DEVCLASS(9), DEVICE(9), DRIVER(9), MAKE_DEV(9) (Device management) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=devclass

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=device

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=driver

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=make_dev

Use FreeBSD implementation as far as possible.  FreeBSD has a nice API for
dynamic device handling.  It may be interesting for RTEMS to use this API
internally in the future.

=== BUS_SPACE(9), BUS_DMA(9) (Bus and DMA access) ===

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bus_space

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bus_dma

Likely BSP dependent.  A default implementation for memory mapped linear access
is easy to provide.  The current heap implementation supports all properties
demanded by bus_dma (including the boundary constraint).

== RTEMS Replacements by File Description ==

Note:  Files with a status of USB are used by the USB test and have at least
been partially tested.  If they contain both USB and Nic, then they are used
by both and MAY contain methods that have not been tested yet.  Files that
are only used by the Nic test are the most suspect.

== Notes by File ==

altq_subr.c - Arbitrary choices were made in this file that RTEMS would
not support tsc frequency change.  Additionally, the clock frequency
for machclk_freq is always measured for RTEMS.

conf.h - In order to add make_dev and destroy_dev, variables in the cdev
structure that were not being used were conditionally compiled out. The
capability of supporting children did not appear to be needed and was
not implemented in the rtems version of these routines.

== Problems to report to FreeBSD ==

The MMAP_NOT_AVAILABLE define is inverted on its usage.  When it is
defined the mmap method is called. Additionally, it is not used 
thoroughly. It is not used in the unmap portion of the source.
The file rec_open.c uses the define MMAP_NOT_AVAILABLE to wrap
the call to mmap and file rec_close.c uses the munmap method.
